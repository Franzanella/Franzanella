My name is Franciele Zanella from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been studying as Front-End and Back-End Developer since 2016 and currently 
i'm doing IT management college

In my free time I like to play videogames (:video_game:), to watch movies and series (:tv:), to play the drums (:musical_score:), to listen to music (:musical_note:) and eventually I like to play with my pets(:dog:).

Would you like to find me?
